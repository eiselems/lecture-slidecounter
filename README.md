# lecture-slidecounter
Lists information about the amount of slides contained in a folder of PDFs

First step in learning for an exam is to get an overview of the amount of slides.
Often the lecture is separated into multipe PDF files (one for each lecture).
By merging the PDF file we get the total amount of slides easily - but without the information which lecture had how many slides.

As i like to see my progress while revising lectures (e.g. for estimating if I'm on track regarding the exam date) I wrote this script to generate a list which gives an overview of the number of slides in each PDF.
